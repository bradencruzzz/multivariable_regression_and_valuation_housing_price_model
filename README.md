**Day 81/100 of #100DaysOfCode**  
Let's explore housing price data from 1970s Boston and build a predictive model to estimate average home prices using multivariable linear regression with Scikit-learn.

---

## 📊 **Project Overview**

This project dives into the **Boston Housing Dataset**, a classic dataset from the 1970s used for regression analysis. Using **Python** and **Scikit-learn**, we:

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
- Train a **multivariable regression model**
- Predict:
  - The **average home price** in Boston
  - The **price of a random home** with a random set of characteristics

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – Model building and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab** – Development environment

---

## 🧠 **Key Concepts**

- **Multivariable Linear Regression**
- **Model Training & Evaluation**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Predictive Modeling**
- **Randomized Inputs for Model Testing**

📝 Notes
The dataset used is from sklearn.datasets.load_boston, which has since been deprecated.
If you're running this after 2023, consider alternatives like the Ames Housing dataset.

This project is part of my 100 Days of Code journey.

📈 Example Output
🏠 Average predicted home price: $23,452
🏠 Random home's predicted price: $18,730
(Based on features like RM = 5.3, LSTAT = 12.1, etc.)
